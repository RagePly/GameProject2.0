Pixel Format

	Especially the RGBA format
	So for a given pixel, you have 4 bytes (8 bits) of information
	char R,G,B,A (remember, one char is one byte)

	pixel data is in series: R,G,B,A, R,G,B,A and so on

	therefore, if you loop through pixels, you have to multiply y * 4 * width and x * 4 to cycle through pixels. 

	and then 
			pixels[index + 0] = byte R red
			pixels[index + 1] = byte G green
			pixels[index + 2] = byte B blue
			pixels[index + 3] = byte A alpha
